Once again, I wish to thank the referee for their insightful feedback. I have detailed my response to each of the referee's points below.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item % 1.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        \item 
        \item
    \end{enumerate}
    \item % 2
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item I have amended the abstract to limit the masses covered to those within the bounds of $m^2_{BF} < m^2 \leq 0$.
        \item I have included reference [26] at the end of page 5. 
        \item Yes, the ``and'' was intended to be an ``an.'' I have made the appropriate correction.
        \item The duplication has been removed.
        \item I have corrected $T_\ell$ to $\overline{T}_\ell$ above section 3.2.
        \item Indeed, in these two cases $S_\ell = \overline{T}_\ell$.  In later sections, however, we consider cases where $S_\ell$ contains contributions from multiple resonant channels (e.g. Figures 3, 4, 5). In these cases $S_\ell$ is the sum of these channels. Therefore, while the notation may seem redundant for early uses, I believe it provides consistency by always representing the sum of all resonant channels. 
        \item I agree that (2.21) is incorrect; I have removed the factor of $\cos (\omega_\ell t + \varphi_\ell)$ so that the equation is of the form of (42) in [17]. 
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}
