I would like to thank the referee for their detailed and constructive
report, and I hope the changes I have outlined here have addressed their
concerns. Because the report covered several topics, I will address each
of these through the numbering given in the report.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item % 1.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The issue of the existence of both types of modes being
        present at all times has been expanded upon at the end of section 2 
        following equation (2.19).
        \item If I have misunderstood the referee's comment here, I apologize and would be 
        happy to reconsider their comment. However, I believe the referee may be mistaken on this
        point. Let us allow for integer frequency values for the non-normalizable solutions,
        and examine the general solution for a massless scalar in $d$ dimensions (as 
        per the example put forward in the report). The spatial part of the scalar field
        is given by
        \begin{align}
            \label{e:NN function}
            E_I (x) = K_I \left( \cos x \right)^{\Delta^+} {_2}F_1 \left(\frac{\Delta^+ + \omega_I}{2}, \frac{\Delta^+ - \omega_I}{2}; \frac{d}{2}; \sin^2 x \right)
        \end{align}
        where $K_I$ is a constant, and $\Delta^+ = d$ for a massless field. Now, we
        consider values of $\omega_I = 2i + d$ and examine $E_I$ the origin:
        \begin{align}
            E_I(0) = K_I \; {_2}F_1 \left( i + d, -i; \frac{d}{2}; 0 \right)
        \end{align}
        According to the \href{https://dlmf.nist.gov/15.2}{DLMF}, the hypergeometric function
        ${_2}F_1 (a, b; c; z)$ exists on the disk $| z | < 1$ provided that $c \neq 0, -1, -2, \ldots$
        which the number of dimensions, $d$, always satisfies. Furthermore, we can write
        \begin{align}
            {_2}F_1 (a, b; c; z) = \sum_{s = 0}^\infty \frac{(a)_s (b)_s}{\Gamma(c + s) s!} z^s
        \end{align}
        for all values of $c$. This clearly demonstrates that \eqref{e:NN function} does not
        diverge at the origin and therefore constitutes a valid field decomposition.
        \item I have expanded on the issue of including either one or three non-normalizable modes at the end of section 2. The particular case raised by the referee can be addressed using additional information from [31]. As addressed under equation (2.6), we can write the general solution for a scalar field with generic frequency $\omega$ as the linear combination of a purely normalizable part $\Phi^+$ with a purely non-normalizable part $\Phi^-$ as ${\phi_\omega = C^+ \Phi^+ + C^- \Phi^-}$ where the coefficients are
        \begin{align}
            \label{Cplus}
            C^+ &= \frac{\Gamma(d/2) \Gamma(- \sqrt{d^2 + 4m^2} / 2)}{\Gamma\Big( (\Delta^- + \omega)/2 \Big) \Gamma\Big( (\Delta^- - \omega) / 2 \Big)} \\
            \label{Cminus}
            C^- &= \frac{\Gamma(d/2) \Gamma(\sqrt{d^2 + 4m^2} / 2)}{\Gamma \Big( (\Delta^+ + \omega) / 2 \Big) \Gamma \Big( (\Delta^+ - \omega) / 2 \Big)} \, 
        \end{align}
        and the functions $\Phi^\pm$ are
        \begin{align}
            \label{Phiplus}
            \Phi^+ &= \left( \cos(x) \right)^{\Delta^+} {_2}F_1 \left( \frac{\Delta^+ + \omega}{2}, \frac{\Delta^+ - \omega}{2}, \Delta^+ +1 - \frac{d}{2}; \cos^2 x \right) \\
            \label{Phiminus}
            \Phi^- &= \left( \cos(x) \right)^{\Delta^-} {_2}F_1 \left( \frac{\Delta^- + \omega}{2}, \frac{\Delta^- - \omega}{2}, \Delta^- + 1 - \frac{d}{2} ; \cos^2 x \right)
        \end{align}
        When the frequency $\omega$ is set to an integer that satisfies ${\omega = \omega_i = 2i + \Delta^+}$, \eqref{Cminus} is zero and so $\phi_{\omega_i} = C^+ \Phi^+$, i.e. the field is \emph{entirely normalizable}. Interestingly, for the particular choices of $m^2 = 0$, $d=4$, and $\omega = 2$ as suggested, it is $C^+$ than vanishes so that $\phi_\omega = C^- \Phi^-$. However, in this case ${\Delta^- = 0}$ so that
        \begin{align}
            \phi\,\Big|_{\omega = 2} \propto {_2}F_1 \left( 1, -1, -1; \cos^2 x \right) \, .
        \end{align}
        Since ${{_2}F_1 (a, b, b; z) = (1 - z)^{-a} \; \forall \; b}$, 
        \begin{align}
            \phi\,\Big|_{\omega=2} \propto \sin^2 x \, ,
        \end{align}
        which clearly goes to one as $x \to \pi/2$, making this a normalizable mode.
        \item 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item % 2.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The final paragraph of section 4 was added to an expanded discussion of the holographic mappings
        between different components of the bulk field to the energy of the boundary CFT in section 2. Additional
        references to preliminary material on the topic of bulk/boundary mappings that underpin the 
        theoretical motivation for studying non-normalizable modes were also added.

    \item % 5.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Please see the response to 1(b) where I have addressed the issue of the regularity 
        of the basis functions $\Phi^\pm_i(x)$.
        \item Since the basis functions for the normalizable modes $e_j(x)$ vanish at the boundary
        ${x \to \pi/2 \; \forall \; j}$, the first term in equation (2.11) is exactly zero while the 
        summation in the second term collapses to a single expression. I believe the wording here 
        accurately describes the simplification of (2.11).
        \item This sentence describes the existence of \emph{naturally vanishing} resonances, such 
        as those given in equations (3.5) and (3.7). These terms evaluate to zero for several choices 
        of the scalar field mass $m \neq 0$. When $m = 0$, [\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6273.pdf}{17}]
        has shown that $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$ vanish for all allowed frequencies by orthogonality of the 
        basis functions. Since chapter 4 demonstrates that there are no resonances that naturally 
        vanish in this fashion, I believe this sentence is correct as it stands.
        \item I have rewritten equation (4.2) as an expansion in $\tilde x$ to make the expression consistent.
        \item I have reduced the three expressions to a single expression that allows for relabeling of the normalizable index.
        \item I have corrected $T_\ell$ to read $\overline{T}_\ell$ in the paragraph below (4.2).
        \item 
        \item Yes, (4.9) and (4.10) are indeed applicable for $m^2 = 0$. I have changed the language around (4.9) and (4.10) to make this clearer.
        \item
